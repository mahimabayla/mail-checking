INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect & classify spam emails. Email spam is a persistent issue, and an efficient spam filter can help users save time and avoid potential security threats. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate and reliable spam detection system.

DATASET OVERVIEW

The dataset used in this notebook is a collection of emails labeled as either "spam" or "ham"(not spam). The dataset contains the following columns:

* Label : The classification of the email as "spam" or "ham".
* Text : The content of the email.

The dataset is used to train and evaluate various machine learning models or spam detection.

DATA PREPROCESSING

* Text Cleaning : Removing HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters.
* Tokenization : Splitting text into individual words.
* Null Values : Filling the null rows and columns.
* Vectorization : Converting text data into numerical format using label encoding.

MODEL TRAINING

The notebook demonstrates training a machine learning model, including:

* Logistic Regression : A linear model for binary classification.

CONCLUSION

The notebook concludes with a summary of findings, highlighting the best-performing model and discussing potential improvements and future work for enhancing spam detection systems.

DEPENDENCIES

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
